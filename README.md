## MAN Pre-interview test

###Algorithms

Implement the method `nextNum()` and a minimal but effective set of unit tests. Implement in the language of your choice, Python is preferred, but Java and other languages are completely fine. Make sure your code is exemplary, as if it was going to be shipped as part of a production system.

As a quick check, given Random Numbers are `[-1, 0, 1, 2, 3]` and Probabilities are `[0.01, 0.3, 0.58, 0.1, 0.01]` if we call `nextNum()` 100 times we may get the following results. As the results are random, these particular results are unlikely.

-1: 1 times
0: 22 times
1: 57 times
2: 20 times
3: 0 times

#### Languages
#####Python
You may use `random.random()` which returns a pseudo random number between 0 and 1.

```python
import random


class RandomGen(object):
    # Values that may be returned by next_num()
    _random_nums = []
    # Probability of the occurence of random_nums
    _probabilities = []

    def next_num(self):
        """
        Returns one of the randomNums. When this method is called
        multiple times over a long period, it should return the
        numbers roughly with the initialized probabilities.
        """
        pass
```
Please describe how you might implement this more "pythonically"
